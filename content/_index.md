I'm a USA-based software engineer with 15 years of experience in GNU/Linux system software and embedded devices.

I only work remotely, as I've done since 2016. I became an employee at [Meteorcomm](https://www.meteorcomm.com) in 2022 after years of contracting for them. At Meteorcomm I develop radio frequency firmware for devices which advance railroad safety and operate on a nearly-nationwide 220Mhz radio network.

I have an M.Sc. in Computer Science from [Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu), and a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the [University of California, Irvine](https://www.uci.edu). I posted some [interesting academic work here](/pages/academic-work/).

[I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail and hiked parts of the Pacific Crest Trail in 2014 and 2015.](/pages/backpacking/)
