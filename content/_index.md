# About me
I'm a USA-based software engineer with 15 years of experience in GNU/Linux system software and embedded devices. I've worked in many industries, including logistics, passenger aircraft, space launch, academia, and sports photography.

### Work & academics
I became an employee at [Meteorcomm](https://www.meteorcomm.com) in 2022 after years of contracting for them.

My most enduring business relationship was with [Safran S.A.](https://www.safran-group.com), where I served as a contract system software generalist. Their myriad embedded devices in the areas of seatback in-flight entertainment, in-flight WiFi, and aircraft cabin power delivery gave me opportunity to work with everything from bootloaders (BareBox and U-Boot) to Qt5/QML.

I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science from [Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu). I also have a Bachelors in Computer Engineering from [The University of California, Irvine](https://www.uci.edu). I posted some [interesting academic work here.](/pages/academics)


### Personal

[I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail and hiked parts of the Pacific Crest Trail in 2014 and 2015.](/pages/backpacking/)

I live in Vancouver, WA, USA with my wife, Erica, and two beautiful sons.

I do not use social media, though I maintain accounts on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ut3) and [Github](https://github.com/ut3).

I play recreational ice hockey, and sometimes have injuries to prove it.
