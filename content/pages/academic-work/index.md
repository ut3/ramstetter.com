### [Applications and Security of Next-Generation, User-Centric Wireless Systems](mdpi-future-internet-ramstetter-yang-yao-20100728.pdf)

Publication in an open-access journal, [MDPI's future internet](www.mdpi.com/journal/futureinternet). Date: 2010/07/28

> **Abstract:** Pervasive wireless systems have signiﬁcantly improved end-users’ quality of
life. As manufacturing costs decrease, communications bandwidth increases, and contextual
information is made more readily available, the role of next generation wireless systems in
facilitating users’ daily activities will grow. Unique security and privacy issues exist in these
wireless, context-aware, often decentralized systems. For example, the pervasive nature
of such systems allows adversaries to launch stealthy attacks against them. In this review
paper, we survey several emergent personal wireless systems and their applications...

### [Stamping and Extracting Bump Maps](rick-ramstetter-stamping-and-extracting-bump-maps-20090505.pdf)

Rutgers M.Sc. coursework in which my lab partner and I implemented a "copy and paste" interface for editting graphics meshes. Date: 2009/05/05

> **Abstract:** We have implemented a “copy and paste” styled interface for mesh editting. This interface allows the user to both
a) input a grayscale bump-mapping image and “stamp” this image onto parts of a loaded mesh, and b) extract grayscale
bump-mapping images from a given mesh. For stamp application, mesh faces are umpsampled via Sqrt- 3 subdivision for high gradient
areas of the bump-mapping im- age. Relevant vertices are then moved along their smoothed-surface nORMAL to achieve their new,
post-stamping position. For extrac- tion, relevant areas of the mesh are interpolated via Moving Least Squares in order to
meet the user’s stamp size and resolution requirements.

### [Modifying Bochs IA32 emulator to simulate a 2-level cache](rick-ramstetter-bochs-2-level-cache-20101203.pdf)

Rutgers M.Sc. coursework in which my lab partners and I modified the Bochs IA32 emulator to contain a one-off 2-level cache simulator. Date: 2010/12/03

> **Assignment:** ...Your job is to show, for each of these benchmarks, the impact of cache
parameters such as total size, line size, associativity, and miss latencies on cache miss rates and average
memory access times...

### [Simulation and evaluation of Bezier-spline Trajectory Based Routing](rick-ramstetter-simulation-of-bezier-spline-trajectory-based-routing-20100419.pdf)

Rutgers M.Sc. coursework in which I simulated and evaluated a trajectory-based routing protocol in Matlab. Date: 2010/04/19

:warning: This draft copy has typos.

> **Abstract:** In dense sensor networks, Trajectory Based Routing (TBR) allows a source node to encode in some
packet’s header a mathematical (e.g. polynomial) curve deﬁning that packet’s route. Intermediary nodes
make a best-effort to route the packet along this curve. Bezier curves, used widely in computer graphics,
allow message trajectories to be described by complex and non-invertable curves. In this work, I imple-
ment in Matlab a generalized simulator for TBR protocols in dense sensor networks. Atop that simulator,
I implement multiple variations of the same Bezier-spline routing protocol. By using a Bezier-spline
representation of trajectories...

### [IPv4 will remain sufficient in North America for the next 30 years](rick-ramstetter-IPv4-sufficient-in-North-America-20081128.pdf)

Rutgers M.Sc. coursework in which I argued that IPv4 will suffice in North America until the year 2039. Date: 2008/11/28

:warning: This draft copy has typos.

> **Abstract:** ...These extensions to IPv4’s lifetime have led
many to question the urgency of deploying IPv6. While recognizing that IPv4’s lifetime
is indeed finite, I argue that such questioning is warranted, and that IPv4 will be sufficient
in North America for at least the next 30 years....
