Before I became a Meteorcomm employee in 2022, I relied on the positive feedback of my consulting clients for success. This is what those clients had to say:

> "Rick provided 6 well-documented merge requests (MRs) on concerns found in the [:warning:redacted]. The MRs included both a description of the found issue and the action the [:warning:redacted] team took to advance progress on integrating the software into the [:warning:redacted] product. Several were actual code changes that could be incorporated into [:warning:redacted]. At least one was a simple stop-gap that required deeper action from the [:warning:redacted] team."\

#### Linux driver for a bug affecting ~20,000 shipped units
> “… Reduced passenger initiated resets by 10%. …”\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -- Sam Carswell, Co-CTO, Zodiac Inflight Innovations (now Safran Passenger Innovations)

#### Seat actuation controllers
> "Our work with Rick involved low level communications between an RS-485 seat actuation system and our IFE System. Under an extremely tight schedule for one of our most important customers, Rick provided a software solution that met our customer’s needs with a high degree of quality. The requirements for this software were fluid and Rick was agile enough to update the design and implementation to meet the new requirements in a timely manner while communicating effect with stakeholders."\
> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -- John Aoki, Sr. Software Manager, Safran Passenger Innovations

#### Multicast in-flight content distribution 
> "Rick is an outstanding software engineer. I worked with him both on a team which I was leading as well as together on a team as co-equals. Rick invest in himself to improve his abilities by seeking to learn the best way to accomplish a task. He is highly knowledgeable, capable of working on his own or working within a team."\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -- David Diepenbrock, Technical Lead, Safran Passenger Innovations Content Load 2 team

> "Rick is one of our top developers... He works hard and develops top quality code. He doesn't shy away from working on code he's not familiar with..."\

## Gnarbox

{{< figure src="gnarbox.svg" alt="MyGnar, Inc. (DBA Gnarbox)" width="200" link="https://web.archive.org/web/20180224042302/https://www.gnarbox.com/" >}}


Gnarbox was the world’s first mobile solution for viewing, backing-up, editing, and sharing HD footage. 

They needed a platform device driver to control a USB port mux based on the status of GPIO/interrupt lines. I authored this driver, in addition to helping with various other low-level issues. Though this startup is defunct, they were a lot of fun to work for.


#### USB power driver control

> “… The mux switch and gpio config are out in the field with a few thousand users and still going strong, so well done…”\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -- Mike Lemmon, CTO, Gnarbox (MyGnar Inc)
