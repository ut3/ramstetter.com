## Appalachian Trail, 2014

I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail.

> The Appalachian Trail, also called the A.T., is a hiking trail in the Eastern United States, extending almost 2,200 miles between Springer Mountain in Georgia and Mount Katahdin in Maine, and passing through 14 states. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy claims the Appalachian Trail to be the longest hiking-only trail in the world. More than three million people hike segments of the trail each year.\

## Pacific Crest Trail, 2015

I hiked about 1/3 of the Pacific Crest Trail, from Mexico to Reds Meadow in the Sierra Nevada.

> The Pacific Crest Trail, officially designated as the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, is a long-distance hiking and equestrian trail closely aligned with the highest portion of the Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges, which lie 100 to 150 miles east of the U.S. Pacific coast. The trail's southern terminus is next to the Mexico–United States border, just south of Campo, California, and its northern terminus is on the Canada–US border...\
